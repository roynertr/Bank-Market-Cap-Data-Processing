Long Description
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to analyze global banking market capitalization data. It begins by extracting bank and market cap data from a JSON file. The extracted data is then transformed by converting the market cap currency using exchange rate data. Finally, the transformed data is loaded into a separate CSV file for further analysis or visualization. This project demonstrates practical application of data extraction, data transformation, and file handling in Python."

This description provides a clear, concise overview of your project, and communicates the key steps involved in the ETL process.
